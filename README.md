  I have been working through the Rosalind bioinformatics problems for the last week. I have made some progress, but I have clearly forgotten many of the foundational python concepts I should be more aware of. 
  I have exams in a week.

  Been a while. Back to coding on this more actively to build up my portfolio. Trying to complete 70 stronghold problems before the beginning of second year; fingerscrossed I won't bomb that, especially while also trying to fatten the data science repository + working on tfip website. Should try implenting branching for stronghold folder.
